# Admin UI

Disc ships with a built-in web-based admin interface for browsing schemas, viewing data, running queries, and inspecting migrations. The UI is built with SvelteKit and served as static assets by the Disc server.

---

## Accessing the UI

Open the admin UI in your default browser:

```bash
disc ui
```

This navigates to `http://localhost:5656/ui`. If the server is running on a different port, pass it explicitly:

```bash
disc ui --port 8080
```

You can also navigate directly in any browser while the Disc server is running. The UI is served from the `/ui` route on the same host and port as the HTTP API.

The header bar shows a connection status indicator. When the UI connects to the server successfully, the indicator turns green and displays "connected". If the server is unreachable, the indicator stays amber in a "connecting" state.

---

## Dashboard

The root page (`/ui`) is the dashboard. It displays four summary cards:

- **Schema Types** -- number of object types defined in your schema.
- **Total Objects** -- total number of objects across all types.
- **Active Connections** -- current open connections to the database.
- **Queries Today** -- number of queries executed in the current day.

Below the summary cards, two panels appear side by side:

- **Recent Queries** -- the last few EdgeQL queries executed against the server. Click any query to load it in the query editor.
- **Quick Actions** -- shortcuts to Browse Schema, New Query, View Data, and Migrations.

---

## Schema

Navigate to **Schema** in the header bar, or go to `/ui/schema`.

The schema browser displays your object types in a two-panel layout:

**Left sidebar** -- a searchable list of all object types. Each entry shows the type name and the total count of properties and links. Type the name of a type in the search field to filter the list.

**Right detail panel** -- when you select a type, the detail panel shows:

- **Properties** -- each property listed with its name, scalar type, and flags (`required`, `multi`). Required properties are marked with a red badge; multi properties with a blue badge.
- **Links** -- each link listed with its name, target type, and cardinality. An arrow indicates the direction of the relationship.

Two action buttons appear in the type header: "View Data" navigates to the data viewer filtered to that type, and "Query Builder" opens the query editor pre-populated with a SELECT for that type.

The `SchemaTree` component provides an alternative tree view of the schema organized by module. Types can be expanded to reveal their properties and links inline. Properties display their scalar type in a green badge. Required fields and constraints are shown as small labeled badges.

---

## Query

Navigate to **Query** in the header bar, or go to `/ui/query`.

The query editor provides a code editing environment for writing and executing EdgeQL queries.

**Editor pane.** The main editing area uses CodeMirror with SQL syntax highlighting and the One Dark theme. Line numbers are displayed in a gutter along the left edge. Press `Cmd+Enter` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Enter` (other platforms) to execute the current query.

**Toolbar.** Three buttons sit above the editor:

- **Format** -- reformats the query text for readability.
- **Save** -- saves the current query with a name. Saved queries appear in the sidebar.
- **Execute** -- runs the query against the server and displays results below.

**Sidebar.** The left sidebar has two sections:

- **Saved Queries** -- named queries saved during this session. Click any entry to load it into the editor.
- **History** -- the 20 most recent queries, stored in browser localStorage. Click to reload.

**Results table.** After execution, results appear in a table with column headers matching the query shape. The execution time is displayed in milliseconds. A "Clear" button dismisses the results.

**Error display.** If a query fails, an error message appears between the editor and results area with the error text from the server.

**Multi-tab support.** The `QueryEditor` component supports multiple tabs. Click the "+" button to open a new query tab. Each tab maintains its own query text independently. Close tabs with the "x" button on the tab label.

## Builder

Navigate to **Builder** in the header bar, or go to `/ui/query-builder`. This is Disc’s visual query builder — a Disc-original feature (Bundle N, #3b in `docs/disc-original-features.md`) that doesn’t exist in Gel’s UI.

The page is a two-column layout. The **left column** is the form: pick a root type from the dropdown, tick the scalar fields you want returned, optionally tick links and the fields to inline from each link, add filter rows (operator + parameterized value), set order/limit/offset. The **right column** is the synthesized EdgeQL — it updates live as you change the form, so every choice you make corresponds to a line in the query that runs.

A **Copy** button in the EdgeQL pane copies the current query + variables to the clipboard. A **Run** button executes the query through the same `/query` pipeline as the Query editor — so access policies, read-only mode, and the auth gate compose identically. Results render in the same table-or-JSON view as the Query and Data pages, so the mental model carries over.

Filter operators supported: `=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`. Multiple filters AND together with parens. Link expansion is one level deep — deeper nesting is supported by EdgeQL but the form doesn’t surface it (use the Query editor for those). Cross-link filters (e.g., `.author.email = ...`) are scoped out of v1.

Identifier safety is enforced before any name lands in the EdgeQL string: type names, shape fields, link names, and order fields are all validated against `^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$`. Synthesis errors surface inline.

The Builder pairs naturally with the Query editor: build a starting query visually, copy it across, then refine in raw EdgeQL.

---

## Disc

Navigate to **Disc** in the header bar, or go to `/ui/disc`. This is the **identity-disc visualization** — a Disc-original feature (Bundle O, #3d in `docs/disc-original-features.md`) and the page that gave the project its name. Click an object and see it rendered as a luminous disc, with outgoing links radiating out one side and incoming references arriving on the other.

**Picker bar.** Pick a type from the first dropdown; the second dropdown populates with up to 25 of that type’s objects (using a heuristic display field — `name` → `title` → `email` → `label`, falling back to a truncated id). Click **Show disc** to render.

**Disc canvas.** The selected object sits at the center, glowing. Two concentric rings frame the orbit. Outgoing links sweep a 120° arc on the right semicircle (centered on 3 o’clock). Incoming references sweep the same arc on the left (centered on 9 o’clock). Each cluster carries one orbital node labeled with the type and target; clusters of multiple links show a `+N` count badge.

**Navigation.** Click any orbital node to recenter the disc on that object. The previous center pushes onto a breadcrumb stack — a **← Back (N)** button pops back through the trail, so you can drill into a graph and walk back without losing your place.

**Data shape.** Outgoing data comes from one query that walks `type.links` and inlines `{ id, displayField }` for every link. Incoming data comes from a schema-walk of every type’s links looking for ones that target the centered type, followed by a parallel `Promise.all` of `select Source filter .linkName.id = <uuid>$id limit 6` — forward-filter syntax keeps the request layer free of EdgeQL backlink syntax.

What’s deliberately not in v1: orbit animations, per-cluster expansion (multi-link clusters show `+N` but only navigate to the first target), abstract-type backlink walking, smarter display-field heuristics, and history persistence across page reloads.

---

## Data

Navigate to **Data** in the header bar, or go to `/ui/data`.

The data viewer lets you browse objects by type. Select a type from the dropdown to load its data into a table.

The `DataGrid` component powers the table view and supports:

- **Search** -- a text field filters rows across all visible columns.
- **Sorting** -- click any sortable column header to sort ascending or descending. The active sort column is highlighted.
- **Pagination** -- when enabled, data is paginated with Previous/Next buttons and a page counter.
- **Row selection** -- checkboxes for selecting individual rows or all rows at once.
- **Inline editing** -- double-click any cell to edit its value. Press Enter to save, Escape to cancel.
- **Export** -- export the current filtered and sorted dataset.

The data viewer communicates with the server through the API client, which provides `getData`, `insertObject`, `updateObject`, and `deleteObject` methods for full CRUD operations.

### Live Mode (Bundle L — Disc-original feature #3c)

The header bar’s **Live** toggle subscribes the data viewer to changes on the currently-selected type’s table. With Live on, every INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to that table — from any client, including other Disc connections, REST callers, or `disc shell` — triggers an automatic re-fetch within ~250 ms. The rows pane briefly pulses with a luminous green border each time an invalidation lands so it’s obvious that the table updated even when row counts didn’t change.

Under the hood:

- `GET /admin/data-watch?tables=<comma-separated-pg-table-names>` opens an SSE stream of `invalidate` events.
- The first event is `ready` with the resolved table set so the client can verify it subscribed to what it intended.
- Subsequent `invalidate` events carry `{ tables: [...], at: <ms> }`. The client refetches the same `select` it ran initially, so access policies, read-only mode, and the auth gate all apply identically to the refetch.
- Server-side, AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE triggers (statement-level — one log row per bulk mutation, not per row) write to a `disc_change_log` table. A polling registry reads new rows on a 250 ms cadence and fans invalidations to subscribers.

Reusable from custom Svelte routes:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { liveQuery } from "$lib/stores/live-query";
  import { onDestroy } from "svelte";

  const { store, close } = liveQuery({
    edgeql: "select User { name, email }",
    tables: ["users"],
  });

  $: ({ data, status } = $store);
  onDestroy(close);
</script>

{#if status === "loading"}<p>Loading…</p>{/if}
{#if data}<pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>{/if}
```

Disabled via `disc.toml` `[server] enable_data_watch = false`, env `DISC_ENABLE_DATA_WATCH=false` (see [Server → Admin Features env vars](server.md#admin-features)), or `ServerConfig.enableDataWatch: false`. When disabled, both the trigger bootstrap and the SSE endpoint are skipped — production deployments that don’t surface the admin UI can opt out to avoid the per-mutation log row.

---

## REPL

Navigate to **REPL** in the header bar, or go to `/ui/repl`.

The web REPL mirrors the experience of `disc shell` in the browser. It provides a scrollable history area and a command input at the bottom.

- The prompt displays `disc>` followed by a text input field.
- Type an EdgeQL command and press Enter to execute it.
- Results appear above the input, with commands shown in blue and results in green.
- The full session history scrolls upward as you enter more commands.
- Use Shift+Enter to enter multi-line queries.

The REPL uses the same API endpoint (`/api/repl`) as the CLI shell, so behavior is identical.

---

## Diff

Navigate to **Diff** in the header bar, or go to `/ui/diff`.

The live schema diff watches your project’s `dbschema/default.disc` file in real time and shows the difference between the **applied schema** (what the running server believes is in the database) and the **on-disk schema** (whatever the editor most recently saved). This is a Disc-original feature -- Gel’s UI shows the applied schema only, so operators have to switch to their editor and CLI to make changes.

**Connection status.** A status pip in the page header shows `connecting` (amber pulsing) → `live` (green) → `disconnected` (red). The page subscribes to a Server-Sent Events stream at `/admin/schema-watch`; if the connection drops, the pip turns red and a banner appears.

**Diff layout.** When the schema is in sync, a single "Schema is in sync" banner appears. When changes exist, the page renders a grid of diff cards:

- **Added types** appear with a green border and a `+ added` badge. Each card lists the type’s properties + links so you can review the full surface before applying.
- **Removed types** appear with a red border and a `− removed` badge.
- **Modified types** appear with a yellow border and a `~ modified` badge. The card body groups changes by category: added properties (green), removed properties (red), changed properties (yellow, with a before → after triple), and the same three groups for links.

**Apply strip.** When the diff is non-empty, a horizontal strip appears above the grid showing total counts (`+N ~M −K`) and an **Apply Migration** button. Clicking it sends a `POST` to `/admin/schema-apply` which runs the migration through the same engine the CLI uses (`SchemaManager.applySchema`) -- you get the `lock_timeout` pragma, the advisory-lock serialization, and the classification gate without any extra plumbing.

**Force toggle.** The classification gate refuses unsafe operations (drops, type recreations) and ambiguous operations (type narrowing without an explicit cast, optional → required without a default, single ↔ multi cardinality changes) by default. Tick the **Force (allow unsafe / ambiguous)** checkbox to opt in -- the request goes out with `?force=true` and the engine proceeds. This matches the CLI’s `disc migrate --unsafe` semantics.

**Parse errors.** If the on-disk SDL fails to parse mid-edit, the page surfaces every parse error with line numbers in a yellow banner instead of pretending the diff is "clean". The watcher keeps retrying so the page heals as soon as you save valid SDL.

**Lifecycle.** The watcher uses `Deno.watchFs` on the SDL file’s parent directory and coalesces filesystem events through a 250ms debounce -- a single editor save typically fires 3-4 raw events, which would otherwise trigger four redundant SSE frames. When the client closes the EventSource (page navigation, browser tab close), the watcher tears down automatically.

**Auth.** The `/admin/schema-watch` and `/admin/schema-apply` routes are gated by the same auth gate as `/query`. When `requireAuth` is on (recommended for production), only requests with a valid `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` header reach the handler. In permissive (default-dev) mode the routes are reachable without authentication -- pair `requireAuth=true` with a deployed admin UI.

## Config

Navigate to **Config** in the header bar, or go to `/ui/config`. This page surfaces the running server’s config registry — every `cfg::*` setting Disc knows about, with secret-aware masking so values marked with the built-in `@secret` annotation never leak into the page source.

Each row shows the config key, its current value (masked as `••••••` for secrets), the type, and a brief description from `cfg::describe_settings()`. Secret rows carry a small **Reveal** button — click it to fetch the raw value through an admin-gated endpoint. Non-secret values are shown directly.

The page is read-only — config changes go through `disc.toml` or environment variables, not the UI. The Config page exists so operators can verify what the running server is actually using without grepping logs or reading `disc.toml` from the host.

The underlying API is `GET /config` — also useful from CLI/CI scripts. Secrets are masked there too unless an admin token is presented.

---

## Migrations

Navigate to **Migrations** in the header bar, or go to `/ui/migrations`.

The migration history page lists all migrations in chronological order. Each entry shows:

- **Migration ID** -- the short identifier (e.g., `m001`).
- **Name** -- the migration name derived from the schema change (e.g., `add_user_profile`).
- **Status** -- either "applied" (green badge) or "pending" (amber badge).
- **Applied date** -- the timestamp when the migration was applied, if applicable.

Pending migrations appear with a dashed border and reduced opacity to visually distinguish them from applied migrations.

---

## Health Monitoring

The Disc server exposes health and statistics endpoints that the UI reads:

- `GET /health` -- overall server health, PostgreSQL status, uptime, memory usage, and extension health.
- `GET /health/live` -- liveness probe, returns `{"status": "alive"}`.
- `GET /health/ready` -- readiness probe, returns healthy/degraded/unhealthy.
- `GET /stats` -- connection statistics, query counts, average duration, transaction stats, subscription stats, cache metrics, and rate limit status.
- `GET /metrics` -- Prometheus-compatible metrics when `DISC_ENABLE_METRICS=true`.

The dashboard connection status indicator reflects the result of these health checks.

---

## Configuration

### Disabling the UI

To run the Disc server without serving UI assets:

```bash
disc serve --no-ui
```

The HTTP API remains fully functional. This is useful in production deployments where the admin UI is not needed or is served separately.

### Server Integration

The UI is built as a static SvelteKit application using `adapter-static`. The compiled assets are bundled into the Disc server distribution. When `disc serve` starts, it serves these assets at the `/ui` path prefix. The UI communicates with the server through the same HTTP API available to any client -- there is no special internal protocol.

The API client (`DiscAPIClient`) connects to the server’s base URL and provides methods for:

- `executeQuery(query, variables)` -- run EdgeQL queries.
- `getSchema()` -- fetch all schema types.
- `getType(name)` -- fetch a single type definition.
- `getData(type, options)` -- browse data with filtering, pagination, and sorting.
- `insertObject(type, data)` -- insert a new object.
- `updateObject(type, id, data)` -- update an existing object.
- `deleteObject(type, id)` -- delete an object.
- `getMigrations()` -- list migration history.
- `getConnectionInfo()` -- server version, database name, active connections.
- `executeREPL(command)` -- run a REPL command.
